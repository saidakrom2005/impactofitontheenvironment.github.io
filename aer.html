                	Our team has made a research in some schools and even have recorded some kind of an interview in which it was told about some problems of the schools in remote area.

    			<p class="text">
        
        			1. Limited Resources:

Funding: Rural schools often receive less funding per student than urban schools, which can lead to a shortage of resources such as textbooks, technology, and classroom supplies.
Facilities: Many rural schools have outdated or inadequate facilities, including inadequate heating and cooling systems, limited internet access, and crumbling infrastructure.
Specialized services: Rural schools may not have access to specialized services such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, and mental health counseling, which can be crucial for students with special needs.
    			</p>
        		<p class="text">
                    
                    2. Lack of Access to Technology and Educational Materials:

                    Limited internet access: Many rural areas lack access to high-speed internet, which can limit students' access to online resources and educational technology.
                    Outdated textbooks and materials: Rural schools often have outdated textbooks and other educational materials, which can put students at a disadvantage compared to their peers in urban schools.
                    Limited access to extracurricular activities: Rural schools may offer fewer extracurricular activities than urban schools, which can limit students' opportunities for social and emotional development.
